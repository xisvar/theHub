**TheHub: Final System Overview**  
**Potential & Uniqueness Assessment**  

---

### **1. Market Potential**

- **Web3 Adoption**: Creators increasingly demand ownership (NFTs) and decentralized governance (DAOs).  

**Key Opportunities**:  
- **Underserved Niches**: Retro tech modders, urban gardeners, and cosplay creators lack dedicated platforms.  
- **Hybrid Learning**: Bridging SkillShare‚Äôs tutorials with Reddit‚Äôs community and GitHub‚Äôs collaboration.  
- **Monetization**: Projected $14.2B maker movement market (Grand View Research, 2022).

- **AR/VR Tutorials**: Overlay instructions on real-world workspaces (e.g., ‚ÄúAssemble this circuit here‚Äù).  
- **AI Troubleshooting**: Diagnose project issues via image uploads (e.g., 3D print layer errors).  

#### **C. Anti-Fraud Ecosystem**  
- **Escrow System**: Funds held until delivery confirmation.
